Me challenging myself to build a working retro browser in 6 hours. it kind of works.
<br>
Browser built in Python (biggest mistake ever, but it was not inteded for any real use, so i don't care.)
<br>
It can render basic (retro) (90's style) webpages.
<br>
<h3>It currently supports these HTML elements:</h3>
<h4>-h1,h2,h3,h4,p, titles, and i added image support (img)</h4>
<h3>CSS:</h3>
everything except alignment stuff.
<h2>It supports GET,POST HTTP requests (built from scratch)</h2>

<h3>JavaScript Interpreter:</h3>
<br>work in progress...
